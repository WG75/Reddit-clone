Seemed like the lab would be easy. But no, the lab was to write code to read, write, search, add entries, and delete entries to a txt file glossary. It might seem easy, but this is a 101 level class for people who have never coded in their lives.\n\nI sat with a TA during his tutoring hours for about 3 hours last night trying to write the code, and even he was having a ton of trouble writing this code.\n\nHow can I actually learn how to do what he expects instead of having a TA walk me through it?",
