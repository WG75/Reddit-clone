Even the TAs agree that it's way to hard for beginners, and he doesn't even show up to the labs.\n\nFor example this week in lecture he taught basic string functions like strcmp and the like. Seemed like the lab would be easy. But no, the lab was to write code to read, write, search, add entries, and delete entries to a txt file glossary. It might seem easy, but this is a 101 level class for people who have never coded in their lives.\n\nI sat with a TA during his tutoring hours for about 3 hours last night trying to write the code, and even he was having a ton of trouble writing this code.\n\nHow can I actually learn how to do what he expects instead of having a TA walk me through it?",
